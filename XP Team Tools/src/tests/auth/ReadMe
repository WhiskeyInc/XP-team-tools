HOW TO USE THE AUTHENTICATION PROCEDURES
****************************************

1.  Add to your classpath the mysql-connector*.jar
	and sun.misc.BASE64Decoder.jar included in the libraries folder.
	(There should be no dependency errors at this point).

2.  Run up a MySQL server, although other servers might work.

3.  You have to create a database named extreme01 or set a different one 
	in the Main. Also other params can be configured in there. 
	For ur comfort you can download the dump of the extreme01 db I have created
	for running tests (test.auth.*Auth1,2 etc): http://bit.ly/1b7KoUi or in files folder.
	
4.	However you named your database, there must be a TABLE named CREDENTIAL
	with 5 COLUMNS: USER, PASSWORD, SALT, DATUM, COMMENTS (I put datum and comments
	just for fun).
	
5.  You don't have to create the table manually, just run CreateTableMain.

6.  In order to be able to authenticate you need to "register" a new user, to put a new row:
	to create a new user modify the related parameters in CreateUserMainTest and run it.
	It automatically hashes your data and writes it onto the DB.

7.	Finally, you can run ServerMainAuth and ClientMainAuth 1 or 2 and test the communication.

	P.S. All the files ending with *Auth are needed to make it work, thus when 
	editing code take in mind this is the latest version of the app.

	Have fun.
